"""Short-lived authorization grants.

A grant is minted when an approver proves their PIN, and is spent when the gate lets an
action through. It is deliberately narrow: bound to one action, one requester and one
set of binding values, and dead within :func:`ttl_seconds` seconds.

**Consumption is compare-and-set, not delete.** Redis is not transactional with MariaDB.
If a grant were deleted in ``before_submit`` and a later ``on_submit`` handler threw —
wallet reversal, Magento LP and one-time offer usage all run there — the database would
roll back with the grant already gone, and the approver would have to walk back to the
till and approve a second time. Binding the grant to the document instead makes a retry
of *that* document succeed while any other document still fails.
